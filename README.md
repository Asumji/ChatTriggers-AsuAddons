Current mods:

CarryHelper


Helps with dungeon carries (made for SBM carries specifically).


/register <ign> <runs> Registers a new client with the amount of runs they ordered.

/edit <ign> <runs> Edits the amount of ordered runs

/clear [ign] Removes a specific player or all off the carry list.

/add [ign] Adds 1 run to a specific player or all players. (Runs will automatically be added upon completion
 but for safety this exists)
 
/sub [ign] Removes 1 run from a specific player or all players.
  
2. FragBot


A better FragBot mod than most other mods. (For first time setup go in AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules/AsuAddons/.data.json and add your settings (FragBot's name and your ign in the same format as I did for owner and names))


Will start working as soon as installed but there's a few commands that can be executed through party chat with the prefix #:

#togglemode Toggles between the bot leaving or staying in the party when joining a dungeon.

#toggleperms Toggles between wether only you or everyone can execute commands.

#addplayer <ign> Adds a new player to the players that can invite the bot

#removeplayer <ign> Removes a player from the player that can invite the bot.

#settings Display an overview of the above mentioned settings.
